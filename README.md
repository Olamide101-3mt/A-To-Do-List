💡 Inspiration

There was a time I’d wake up full of ideas about my day — only to forget half by noon. I knew I needed something simple, functional — and personal.

So I built this tool as part of my learning journey with **@AxiaAfrica**'s Frontend Development Program. It’s not just a project — it’s a productivity companion I actually use.
